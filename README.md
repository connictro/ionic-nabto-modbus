# Customized Ionic Modbus app for Nabto Modbus ESP32 and Raspberry Pi IoT demos

This app is based on Nabto 's Modbus example, customized for different Modbus devices like temperature/humidity sensor and multi-port relays.
See https://github.com/nabto/ionic-nabto-modbus for the original app.
This app can control both the ESP32 and the Raspberry Pi-based demos.

For the ESP32 Nabto-Modbus gateway, please see https://github.com/nabto/ionic-nabto-modbus.

This [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) based modbus app is an example of how to create apps using [Nabto](https://www.nabto.com/?p=4156) realtime remote access IoT platform to query modbus devices via a [gateway](https://github.com/nabto/modbus-demo-gateway) created for this specific purpose.

The app is created based upon the [Nabto starter app](https://github.com/nabto/ionic-starter-nabto) so if you want to adjust and build the app yourself, you should read and follow the instruction for that.
